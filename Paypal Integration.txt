Steps to paypal integration:
1. Create developer account in order to get the client ID and make test business and user accounts. Will also be
provided the secret key here. Has tools for checking integration including API calls for testing and production
servers. The client ID will be included in the environment and called in the index.html and PaypalButton component.
2. Added the paypal smart button to the website using a library for react integration.
Documentation: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-paypal-button-v2. Contains all the same functionality as regular
paypal integration. Paypal Button Styles: https://developer.paypal.com/docs/archive/checkout/how-to/customize-button/
3. Transaction is setup with the total price of the objects selected and user is sent to paypal website to sign up,
then while still in paypal popup user is prompted to execute the payment with the "Buy Now" button. We then get a payment
success or failure response on our side containing an order ID and payer ID.
4. Verification is done with the response the server gave us. The order ID from the response is passed to the backend
where it is used to get a report of the transaction including the price. This price is then compared to the total price
of the documents purchased which are passed in as ID's and loaded from the database in order to not permit any tampering
from the client side.
5. Change the testing credentials to actual credentials provided in the business acount and test a transaction in order
to verify everything is in order.
